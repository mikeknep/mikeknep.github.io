<h3>Hi, I'm Mike</h3>
<p>I am a software developer in Chicago, currently working as a resident apprentice at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/" target="_blank">8th Light</a>.</p>
<p>As a proponent of open-source and transparency who has greatly benefited from many others' blog posts outlining various programming obstacles and solutions, I hope to provide some similar value with my blog, <a href="/invisible_cities">Invisible Cities</a>.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding I enjoy rock climbing, playing and watching basketball (go Bulls!), and listening to jazz.</p>

      Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,<br>
      Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,<br>
      Pioneers! O pioneers!
