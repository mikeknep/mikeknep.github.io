  <h3>Hi, I'm Mike</h3>
  <p>I am a web developer working in Chicago, currently splitting my time between a software apprenticeship at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/" target="_blank">8th Light</a> and contracted Rails development with <a href="https://patrol.wireharbor.com/" target="_blank">WireHarbor</a>, a web security startup at <a href="http://www.1871.com/" target="_blank">1871</a>. As a proponent of open-source and transparency who has greatly benefited from many others' blog posts outlining various programming obstacles and solutions, I hope to provide some similar value with my blog, <a href="/invisible_cities">Invisible Cities</a>.</p>
  <p>When I'm not coding I enjoy rock climbing, playing basketball, and listening to jazz.</p>
